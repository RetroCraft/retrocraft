### Hi, I'm James 👋

I'm a full-stack developer focusing on the Node/React stack.
Say what you will about JS, but I much prefer it to PHP.

- 🔭 I like working with non-profits!
  I'm proud to have helped build sites that [distribute](https://risingyouth.ca) youth grants and [facilitate](https://volunteeringpeel.org) student volunteering.
  I've even worked with [the people behind](https://partnershipagainstcancer.ca) Canada's national cancer strategy.
- 🏫 ...but right now, I'm probably doing [some homework](https://github.com/retrocraft/problems) for my CS/BBA double degree at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. If you're in my classes, lend me a hand and PR against those would you?
- 🌱 In my spare time, I've been picking up infosec skills with [my team](https://github.com/TeamOm3ga) &ndash; we placed in the top 1.3% of picoCTF!
  I'd love to do more in that space.
- ✨ And I'm also passionate about open _knowledge_.
  We can have more than just open source: that's why I have [open study materials](https://agony.retrocraft.ca)!
  Volunteer with me to edit Wikipedia or [map the world](https://hotosm.org).
